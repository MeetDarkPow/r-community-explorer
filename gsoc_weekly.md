## Weekly plan for First Coding Month of GSoC 2019 (R-Ladies Dashboard)

### Week 1.

Use `meetupr` and `tidyverse` to retrieve and arrange R-Ladies groups. Update `find_groups()` if possible/required. 
Store resulting data in CSV/JSON files.
        
        
   #### Deliverables
        
   1. Setup Travis CI for this repo to automatically build the project, install `meetupr` and supporting packages,
           and call `deploy.sh`
        
   2. Write bash script (`deploy.sh`) to automatically run rladies.R script and update docs/data/rladies.csv file
           straight from the Meetup API
           
   3. Update `find_groups()` in `meetupr` to retrieve optional fields like `past_event_counts` and `upcoming_event_counts`
           and use it within [R/rladies.R](https://github.com/benubah/r-community-explorer/blob/master/R/rladies.R) script)
        
   4. Submit a passing pull request to rladies/meetupr repo with the changes above
